							<div class="center-block dividerLine"></div>    
							<p>I am a recent graduate with a 2:1 honours Computing BSc degree from the University of Huddersfield. I have a long history and strong interest within the design and development area of software and web applications. I have successfully picked up some experience within this area by completing a year in industry for my placement year and having worked as a junior web developer for an internship.
							<br>
							As a person with Strong communication, good organisational skills and works at a high standard, I believe in self-improvement and taking new challenges while having a passionate to progress further in a career as a developer.
							<br>
							Throughout my degree at the University of Huddersfield, I have developed several technical skills in areas of development. Each year in my course, I was able to pick up different software packages and programming skills through modules assessment and self study. If you are interested in knowing what type of skills I process, feel free to look at the tables below.
